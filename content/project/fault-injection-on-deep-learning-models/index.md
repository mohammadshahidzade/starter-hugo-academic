With the rise of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), many safety-critical applications, such as self-driving cars and healthcare devices, are using them to improve their performance. In these systems, error resilience is a top priority since faults in DNN inference could lead to mispredictions and safety hazards. In this work, I developed a new method to improve the error resiliency of DNNs. I tested this method on several DNN architectures and datasets. For this project, I used PyTorch, a deep learning framework based on Python, to implement and test FitAct.
