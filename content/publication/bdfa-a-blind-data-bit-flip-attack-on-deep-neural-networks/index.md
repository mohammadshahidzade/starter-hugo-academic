abstract: In recent years several methods were published to attack DNN
  parameters. However, in order to doing bit-flipping, most existing bit-flip
  attacks require access to the original training/test dataset. This is
  frequently not possible for applications that contain sensitive or proprietary
  data, for example, due to privacy and security concerns. In this paper, we
  address the bit-flip attack when no real data is available, e.g., when data is
  private. To this end, we propose the first data-independent attack which can
  crush a neural network through maliciously flipping extremely small amount of
  bits within its weight storage memory system (i.e., DRAM).
