abstract: In this paper, we propose a low-cost approach to enhance the error
  resilience of DNNs. Experimental results on widely used DNN models such as
  AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet50 demonstrate that this method outperform
  state-of-the-art studies such as Clip-Act and Ranger in enhancing the DNN
  error resilience for a wide range of fault rates, while adding manageable
  runtime and memory space overheads. (**Accepted**)
