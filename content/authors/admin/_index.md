I am something that should be deleted a B.Sc student in Computer Engineering, from the Department of Computer Engineering ([CE](https://ce.uk.ac.ir/en/home)) at Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman ([SBUK](https://uk.ac.ir/en/home)) under the supervision of professorÂ [Behnam Ghavami](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a0vk8BkAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research focuses on Computer Aided Design, Robust and Reliable Deep Learning models, Efficiency and quantization of Deep Learning models, and parallel programming. Currently, I am working on Quantization and Binarization of Deep learning models.

In september 2020, I won the research-based contest in ICCAD 2020.
